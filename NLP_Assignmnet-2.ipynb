       " '‘that’s the judge,’ she said to herself, ‘because of his great wig.’  the judge, by the way, was the king; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.',\n",
       " '‘how could he turn them out with his nose, you know?’  ‘it’s the first position in dancing.’ alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.',\n",

       " 'while she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.',\n",

       " 'oh dear, what nonsense i’m talking!’  just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.',\n",
       " 'next came an angry voice--the rabbit’s--‘pat!',\n",
       " '‘as wet as ever,’ said alice in a melancholy tone: ‘it doesn’t seem to dry me at all.’  ‘in that case,’ said the dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, ‘i move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--’  ‘speak english!’ said the eaglet.',\n",
       " 'nobody moved.',\n",
       " 'off with his whiskers!’  for some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.',\n",

       " 'it was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself ‘suppose it should be raving mad after all!',\n",
       " '‘i’ve forgotten the words.’  so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the mock turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:--   ‘“will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.',\n",

       " '‘come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said alice to herself, rather sharply; ‘i advise you to leave off this minute!’ she generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.',\n",
       " '‘explain yourself!’  ‘i can’t explain myself, i’m afraid, sir’ said alice, ‘because i’m not myself, you see.’  ‘i don’t see,’ said the caterpillar.',\n",

       " 'no, no!',\n",
       " 'i’m sure i don’t want to stay in here any longer!’  she waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: ‘where’s the other ladder?--why, i hadn’t to bring but one; bill’s got the other--bill!',\n",
       " 'turn that dormouse out of court!',\n",
       " '‘poor little thing!’ said alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.',\n",
       " 'it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.',\n",

       " '‘if everybody minded their own business,’ the duchess said in a hoarse growl, ‘the world would go round a deal faster than it does.’  ‘which would not be an advantage,’ said alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.',\n",
       " 'i’ll set dinah at you!’  there was a dead silence instantly, and alice thought to herself, ‘i wonder what they will do next!',\n",
       " 'it’s enough to drive one crazy!’  the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations.',\n",
       " '‘well, i should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,’ said alice: ‘three inches is such a wretched height to be.’  ‘it is a very good height indeed!’ said the caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).',\n",
       " '‘very true,’ said the duchess: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite.',\n",

       " 'they very soon came upon a gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.',\n",
       " '‘don’t talk nonsense,’ said alice more boldly: ‘you know you’re growing too.’  ‘yes, but i grow at a reasonable pace,’ said the dormouse: ‘not in that ridiculous fashion.’ and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.',\n",
       " '‘i keep them to sell,’ the hatter added as an explanation; ‘i’ve none of my own.',\n",
       " 'the hatter was the first to break the silence.',\n",

       " 'she hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself ‘that’s quite enough--i hope i shan’t grow any more--as it is, i can’t get out at the door--i do wish i hadn’t drunk quite so much!’  alas!',\n",
       " 'i wonder if i shall ever see you any more!’ and here poor alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.',\n",
       " '‘i’ve seen hatters before,’ she said to herself; ‘the march hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is may it won’t be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in march.’ as she said this, she looked up, and there was the cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.',\n",
       " '‘very,’ said alice: ‘--where’s the duchess?’  ‘hush!',\n",
       " '‘if i eat one of these cakes,’ she thought, ‘it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, i suppose.’  so she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly.',\n",
       " 'however, everything is queer to-day.’  just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.',\n",

       " 'she went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.',\n",

       " '‘would you tell me,’ said alice, a little timidly, ‘why you are painting those roses?’  five and seven said nothing, but looked at two.',\n",
       " 'go on!’  ‘i’m a poor man,’ the hatter went on, ‘and most things twinkled after that--only the march hare said--’  ‘i didn’t!’ the march hare interrupted in a great hurry.',\n",
       " 'where can i have dropped them, i wonder?’ alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.',\n",

       " '‘what trial is it?’ alice panted as she ran; but the gryphon only answered ‘come on!’ and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--     ‘soo--oop of the e--e--evening,      beautiful, beautiful soup!’     chapter xi.',\n",
       " 'here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court.',\n",

       " 'do come back again, and we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!’ when the mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, ‘let us get to the shore, and then i’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs.’  it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a duck and a dodo, a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious creatures.',\n",
       " 'at last the mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, ‘sit down, all of you, and listen to me!',\n",
       " '‘i wish i hadn’t mentioned dinah!’ she said to herself in a melancholy tone.',\n",
       " '‘oh, you’re sure to do that,’ said the cat, ‘if you only walk long enough.’  alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.',\n",
       " 'good-bye, feet!’ (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).',\n",
       " 'so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle’s heavy sobs.',\n",

       " 'the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by--the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle.',\n",
       " 'she was up to her chin in salt water.',\n",
       " 'alice gave a little scream of laughter.',\n",
       " '‘once,’ said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, ‘i was a real turtle.’  these words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of ‘hjckrrh!’ from the gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle.',\n",
       " 'there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, [‘which certainly was not here before,’ said alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words ‘drink me’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.',\n",
       " 'i suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!’  ‘i have tasted eggs, certainly,’ said alice, who was a very truthful child; ‘but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.’  ‘i don’t believe it,’ said the pigeon; ‘but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all i can say.’  this was such a new idea to alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding, ‘you’re looking for eggs, i know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?’  ‘it matters a good deal to me,’ said alice hastily; ‘but i’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if i was, i shouldn’t want yours: i don’t like them raw.’  ‘well, be off, then!’ said the pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.',\n",
